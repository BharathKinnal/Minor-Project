In present day technology human-machine interaction is growing in demand and machine needs to understand human gestures and emotions. If a machine can identify human emotions, it can understand human behavior better, thus improving the \textit{task efficiency}. Emotions can understand by text, vocal, verbal and facial expressions (speech can also be used). Facial expressions play big role in judging emotions of a person. It is found that limited work is done in field of real time emotion recognition using facial images. In the base paper \cite{suja2016}, they proposed a method for real time emotion recognition from facial image. The proposed method used three steps face detection using Haar cascade, features extraction using Active shape Model(ASM) and Adaboost classifier for classification of five emotions anger, disgust, happiness, neutral and surprise. Implementation of emotion recognition at real time on Raspberry Pi II is achieved at real time. This process is \textit{parallelized} using Quad-Pi (four Raspberry Pi).
